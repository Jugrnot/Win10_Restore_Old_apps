# Win10_Restore_Old_apps

I'm tired of Microsoft removing the useful, functional apps left over from Windows 7 such as the classic calculator and classic photoviewer for shitty "Windows store" apps that are bloated, often fail, and overall lack functionality of prior versions.  For this reason, and to keep my sanity with fresh installs of Win10, I put together this small repo.

Files:

PhotoViewer - This is a series of reg keys.  
calc.exe - The executable for calc
calc.exe.mui - The executable install package for calc


Instructions:

PhotoViewer
1. Create a photoviewer.reg file and paste contents
2. Append to registry.

Calculator:
1. Create C:\calc
2. Download calc-install.bat, calc.exe, and calc.exe.mui to C:\calc
3. Run calc-install.bat as administrator
4. Answer Y to each
5. ...
6. Profit.
